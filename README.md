ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @g-marcin and Im currently developing my passion for computer-science. 

    Can't wait to get the tools required to create new applications, fix bugs and write new functionalities for existing ones. 
  
For a few years Ive been a computer games freak and one day get intrested in more complex aspects of using computer. 
  
    My journey started while I was onboard the vessel working on repetitive tasks in port documents.
 

Currently learning Javascript and React.

Familiarizing with git-CLI and git-desktop when developing my projects or practicing new technologies to increase my knowledge.

My projects hosted via netlify:
