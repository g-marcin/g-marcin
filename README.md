ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @g-marcin and Im currently developing my passion for computer-science. 

    Can't wait to get the tools required to create new applications, fix bugs and write new functionalities for existing ones. 
  
For a few years Ive been a computer games freak and suddenly get intrested in more complex aspects of using computer. 
  
    My journey started while I was onboard the vessel working on repetitive tasks in port documents.
 
Currently learning Python 3.x to catch fundamentals on programming and computer - apps and web-apps design patterns.(TETRIS project.)
